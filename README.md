Rotor Bearing Install Tool - Project @ Tesla

February 2017 - Project @ Tesla

Tool needed to manually install rotor bearing inside motor-gearbox of drive unit. Tool needs to install bearing so that it sits level in
bore. If it's out of tolerance, this can cause noise issues later on. Mating parts to drive unit are dimensioned appropriately to meet
this requirement.

How it works: a bearing is kept in place on the bottom of the tool with the use of magnets. The bottom piece of the tool is designed
so that it mates to the bearing insert where the bearing will be installed. Once they are mated, the user should be able to use the
spring loaded plunger to place the bearing inside the bore.
